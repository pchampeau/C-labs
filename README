chill.c
This chill program was originally written and tested on an OSX machine however it has also been tested on the
unix machines as well. This program has optional input arguments of temperature and wind velocity respectively.
These inputs must be numbers. If no input is given the program will simply print out a chart of different wind speeds
and temperatures. In addition if a temperature is specified and not a wind speed, a smaller chart will be displayed with 
the given temperature and multiple factory set wind speeds.

compile statement: gcc -Wall -pedantic -std=c11 -o chill.o chill.c -lm
Input format: ./chill.o [temperature] [wind speed]


weather.c
This weather program was originally written and tested on an OSX machine but it has also been tested
on the unix machines. I have tested numerous cases as per the assignment. This program must have a 
single four letter station code as the only argument passed to the function. Formatted as follows

Compile Statement: gcc -Wall -pedantic -std=c11 -o weather.o weather.c -lcurl mycurl.c
Input format: ./weather.o [four letter station code]

Note: if no code or an invalid code is entered, then the user will be prompted accordingly

dog.c
This dog program was originally written and tested on an OSX machine but it has also been tested
on the unix machines. I have tested numerous cases as per the assignment. from just simple echoing of
text to more complex inputs with mutliple switches and files. The accepted input styles are as follows:

Compile Statement: gcc -Wall -pedantic -std=c11 -o dog.o dog.c
Input Format: ./dog.o [-n] [-m] Mapfile [-M] Mapfile [list of target files]

Note: the [-n] switch must be right after the function call, other switches after that, followed by their corresponding files, and then lastly the target file.
If you don not want the dog command to be performed on a file simply leave this input field blank and the program will defaul to stdin for the input.
Note: Do not combine switches in a single dash, each switch must have it's own dash.
