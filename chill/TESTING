This chill program was originally written and tested on an OSX machine however it has also been tested on the
unix machines as well. This program has optional input arguments of temperature and wind velocity respectively.
These inputs must be numbers. If no input is given the program will simply print out a chart of different wind speeds
and temperatures. In addition if a temperature is specified and not a wind speed, a smaller chart will be displayed with 
the given temperature and multiple factory set wind speeds.
