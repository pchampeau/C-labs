This weather program was originally written and tested on an OSX machine but it has also been tested
on the unix machines. I have tested numerous cases as per the assignment. This program must have a 
single four letter station code as the only argument passed to the function. Formatted as follows

./weather.o [four letter station code]

Note: if no code or an invalid code is entered, then the user will be prompted accordingly
