This dog program was originally written and tested on an OSX machine but it has also been tested
on the unix machines. I have tested numerous cases as per the assignment. from just simple echoing of
text to more complex inputs with mutliple switches and files. The accepted input styles are as follows:

./dog.o [-n] [-m] Mapfile [-M] Mapfile [list of target files]

Note: the [-n] switch must be right after the function call, other switches after that, followed by their corresponding files, and then lastly the target file.
If you don not want the dog command to be performed on a file simply leave this input field blank and the program will defaul to stdin for the input.
Note: Do not combine switches in a single dash, each switch must have it's own dash.
